# Changelog

All notable changes to AI Editor are documented here.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-02-10

### Security

- **XSS sanitization pass**: All `innerHTML` paths now escape external data (file names,
  branch names, connection IDs, workflow data, error metadata) via shared `escapeHtml` /
  `escapeAttr` utilities. Previously, malicious repository names, branch names, or Git API
  responses could inject and execute arbitrary scripts.
- **SVG preview sandboxed**: SVG files rendered in the preview pane now pass through
  DOMPurify (if available) or fall back to a `sandbox=""` iframe with no script execution.
- **Consolidated escape functions**: Six duplicate `escapeHtml` implementations across the
  codebase replaced with a single source of truth in `js/utils/html.js`.

**Files modified for XSS fixes:**
  `file-tree.js`, `tab-manager.js`, `project-manager.js`, `ui-helpers.js`,
  `settings-manager.js`, `error-logger.js`, `model-manager.js`, `secondary-pane.js`,
  `chat/messages.js`, `diff-viewer.js`, `quick-open.js`, `search-panel.js`

### Added

- **Resizable preview pane**: Drag handle between editor and preview/diff pane allows
  resizing. Width persists to localStorage across sessions.
- **Preview fullscreen toggle**: Button in secondary pane header (⛶) toggles fullscreen
  mode, hiding the editor and giving the preview/diff the full width.
- **Shared HTML utilities module** (`js/utils/html.js`): Canonical `escapeHtml()` and
  `escapeAttr()` for all HTML construction.

### Changed

- **Dockerfile: python → nginx**: Production image switched from `python3 -m http.server`
  to `nginx:1-alpine`. Adds gzip compression, proper cache headers (immutable for vendor
  bundles, no-cache for app files), and security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options,
  Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy). Image is smaller and significantly faster.

### Fixed

- Preview pane `.ext` indicator was not escaped (minor XSS in file extension display).
- Connection card `providerName` was not escaped in settings UI.
